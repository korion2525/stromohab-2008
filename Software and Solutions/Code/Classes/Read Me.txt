To Build A Client Application:


Include stromohab_08\Visual Studio Solutions\StromoLight_Objects\StromoLight_Objects\bin\Release\Stromolight_Objects.dll

as this .dll file contains all the needed files



If you don't re-add the new files your application will crash as it won't know how to deal with the additional data the server will send it

I have setup a project area for stromohab.

Connect to :

\\ElecFS\StaffFS

and look in 'ShareAreas' for a folder named STROMOHAB


If you have problems connecting then check that you are connecting using your Computing Service username and password.  XP users might need to do the following :


 From the 'Control Panel' select 'User Accounts' and select your account to manage.

Then select 'Manage My Network Passwords' and add an entry exactly as follows :

Server : ElecFS

Username : ElecFS\<username>


Replace <username> with your Computing Service username, and enter your password.

You might get prompted about setting a domain password which you can say 'No' to.


By default everything in \\ElecFS\StaffFS is only accessible to users connected to the Departmental 
network.  Access can be arranged for users connecting via the VPN or NAS but Adar will need to 
approve it.
